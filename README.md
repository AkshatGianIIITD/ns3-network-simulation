# NS3 Based Simulation of a Computer Network

This project involves the simulation of a computer network using the Network Simulator 3 (NS3) platform. The primary goal is to analyze network performance under specific traffic conditions, routing protocols, and link capacities. This simulation provides insights into end-to-end delay, packet loss, and queueing behavior within the defined network topology.

## üåê Network Topology

The simulation implements a hub-and-spoke network topology consisting of 9 nodes: 5 workstations (A, B, C, D, E) and 4 routers (R0, R1, R2, R3). Router R0 acts as the central hub connecting the other three routers.

### Node Connections:
* Workstation **A** is connected to Router **R1**.
* Workstations **B** and **C** are connected to Router **R2**.
* Workstations **D** and **E** are connected to Router **R3**.
* Routers **R1**, **R2**, and **R3** are all connected to the central router **R0**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

### Link Capacities

| Link        | Capacity |
| :---------- | :------- |
| A ‚Üî R1      | 1 Mbps   |
| B ‚Üî R2      | 1 Mbps   |
| C ‚Üî R2      | 1 Mbps   |
| D ‚Üî R3      | 1 Mbps   |
| E ‚Üî R3      | 1 Mbps   |
| R1 ‚Üî R0     | 5 Mbps   |
| R2 ‚Üî R0     | 5 Mbps   |
| R3 ‚Üî R0     | 5 Mbps   |

### Traffic Matrix

The traffic flow between workstations is defined by the following matrix (units are in packets/sec or a similar metric):

| Source / Dest | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   |
| :------------ | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **A** | 0   | 124 | 95  | 56  | 57  |
| **B** | 83  | 0   | 30  | 17  | 55  |
| **C** | 78  | 144 | 0   | 84  | 60  |
| **D** | 59  | 33  | 46  | 0   | 133 |
| **E** | 23  | 14  | 148 | 44  | 0   |

### Routing

Static routing is implemented based on the shortest path. The routing tables direct traffic from source to destination via the most efficient route. For example, any traffic from workstation A to any other node is first sent to router R1.

### Queueing and Error Model

* **Queue Type**: `DropTailQueue` is used for all router links.
* **Queue Size**: The maximum queue length for each outgoing link is set to **50 packets**. Packets arriving at a full queue are dropped.
* **Error Model**: A `RateErrorModel` is introduced to simulate packet loss on links. Two different error rates were used: **0.075%** and **0.08%**, applied to different network devices to simulate unreliable links.

## üìä Simulation Results

### End-to-End One-Way Delay (in milliseconds)

This matrix shows the average one-way delay for packets traveling between each pair of workstations.

| Source / Dest | A      | B      | C      | D      | E      |
| :------------ | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| **A** | 0      | 8.9152 | 8.9152 | 8.9152 | 8.9152 |
| **B** | 8.9152 | 0      | 6.096  | 8.9152 | 8.9152 |
| **C** | 8.9152 | 6.096  | 0      | 8.9152 | 8.9152 |
| **D** | 8.9152 | 8.9152 | 8.9152 | 0      | 6.096  |
| **E** | 8.9152 | 8.9152 | 8.9152 | 6.096  | 0      |

### Packet Drop Percentage (%)

This matrix shows the percentage of packets dropped for each source-destination pair due to queue overflows and induced errors.

| Source / Dest | A      | B      | C      | D      | E      |
| :------------ | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| **A** | 0      | 3.7076 | 2.8405 | 1.6744 | 1.7043 |
| **B** | 2.4817 | 0      | 0.4482 | 0.5083 | 1.6445 |
| **C** | 2.3322 | 2.1514 | 0      | 2.5116 | 1.7940 |
| **D** | 1.7641 | 0.9867 | 1.3754 | 0      | 1.9870 |
| **E** | 0.6877 | 0.4186 | 4.4252 | 0.6574 | 0      |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Simulation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a working installation of NS3.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
3.  **Place the script:** Copy the simulation script (`.cc` file) into the `scratch` directory of your NS3 installation.
4.  **Run the simulation:**
    ```bash
    ./ns3 run scratch/<your-script-name>
    ```
5.  **Analyze Results:** The simulation will generate `.pcap` files for packet analysis and an `.xml` file for NetAnim visualization. Use Wireshark and NetAnim to inspect these files.
